## Install and start the **Nuxt Client**:

- Keep Strapi running, or restart Strapi with either `yarn dev` or `yarn start`.


If you would like to serve in development mode with hot reloading on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

```
yarn dev
```

You will now be able to test the functionality of this demonstration app using Strapi and Nuxt.

**NOTE:** If you would like to actually serve it on a production server, follow these commands instead.

```
yarn build
yarn start

```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [Nuxt.js docs](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js).
